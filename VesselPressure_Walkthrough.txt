1. Turn on the radio to the left of the computer. The radio plays a 4 letter word, which is "BACK". Type "BACK" on the computer terminal.  You have now unlocked the map!
  
2. Look at the fuses next to the door. You must grab a fuse then run it through the blue maze puzzle. The fuse must reach the yellow object at the end of the maze. This will open the door. You have now unlocked the missile room!  

3. To move your vessel on the map: Use the lever on the left of the screen to move forward. Use the valve wheel on the right of the screen to turn around (You must hold E or left mouse to opperate them.) Do not touch the red squares. You may stay in the black or yellow squares.  
  
4. You must destroy the 4 green X marks. For each target: Park your vessel (the white arrow) under each X. Go to the missile room, take 1 missile, load it in the missile launcher on the right-side of the wheel, and use the Missile Launch button. Repeat the process to the other X targets.  

Congrats! You have beaten the game!
